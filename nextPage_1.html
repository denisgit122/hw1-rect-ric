<h4 class="h4_1">Biography</h4>

<p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9]
    is the elder daughter and middle child of the
    Simpson family and one of the two tritagonists
    (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.</p>
<p>In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also
    known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called
    Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic
    8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of the
    intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's
    surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her
    upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge,
    which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar,
    riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies.
    In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as
    a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends.
    She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and
    at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ
    of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing
    out to those who she deems lower than her or even above her.
    She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever
    it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she
    deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one
    who usually thinks things through.</p>
